# lm_1b

This directory should house the necessary files to run inference with the `BIG LSTM+CNN Inputs` model trained on 1 billion words, AKA `lm_1b`, introduced by [Josefowicz et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410).

Populate this directory with the GraphDef pbtxt, vocabulary, and checkpoint files given by the authors: <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/lm_1b>
